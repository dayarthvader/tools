This branch contains the .vimrc file I use in my development projects.  
Currently, it has support for  

File explorer  
Fuzzy file finder  
Code completion using YCM  
colorscheme gruvbox I have used vundle as a pluginmanager The comments in .vimrc should help you configure your setup to your needs.
