This branch contains the .vimrc file I use in my development projects.  
Currently, it has support for
 1. File explorer
 2. Fuzzy file finder
 3. Code completion using YCM
 4. colorscheme gruvbox
 I have used vundle as a pluginmanager
 The comments in .vimrc should help you configure your setup to your needs.
